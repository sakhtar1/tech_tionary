Techtionary

Ever felt there were too many tech words out there and no way to organize them?!
Well guess what there's Techtionary!! Your own dictionary with tech jargons!

Usage
To use this app, just clone, run rake db:migrate and then run shotgun. Everything should be set up.
Once you run shotgun, create your own account, and start adding to your dictionary!
